I want design a game just like Le Petit Prince to simulate the imagination when I was young that one little man is standing/walking on a mini planet, and he has a very interesting story about starts travelling. I just remember that after I tried Cocos and Cocos3D as the develop engine, then finally chose Unity. Hopefully typescript or C# these languages not so strange to me. After 2 month very busy developing and designing, I released the game and name it miniplanet(with a chinese name 小王子没电了) and put it on iOS App Store.
